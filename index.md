# Description

Now I am interested in the following technologies and knowledge:
- DevOps culture and ITIL framework;
- Docker, Docker Compose and Docker Swarm;
- Prometheus, Grafana and Graylog;
- QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols;
- DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-HTTP/3 protocols;
- NGINX and HTTP Rest API protocol experience.

I am just IT-enthusiast and at the moment I have only one active project now - the Docker image of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ammnt/nginx">NGINX with HTTP/3 (QUIC) support</a>.
